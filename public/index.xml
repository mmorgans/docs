      <description>Introduction In general, exporting data to a .csv with rgee is pretty easy. The general gist of the process is:&#xA;Define the area or points you are interested in Filter data Convert the results to a list, and Export to a csv. Example Make sure to load and initialize rgee first!&#xA;# Define an AOI over Kansas aoi &amp;lt;- ee$Geometry$Rectangle(c(-102.05, 36.99, -94.6, 40.0)) # Define sample points in the area points &amp;lt;- ee$FeatureCollection(c( ee$Feature(ee$Geometry$Point(-98.</description>

      <description>Data types (link to method of gathering) MAT (Mean Annual Temperature) Average yearly temperature. MAP (Mean Annual Precipitation) Average yearly precipitation. GPP (Gross Primary Productivity) Total amount of energy captured by plants. Does not account for respiration losses. NPP (Net Primary Productivity) Amount of energy that remains after plants have used some of the captured energy for their own respiration. Actual amount of new biomass that is available for consumption by other critters.</description>

      <description>Introduction Raw data often needs to be transformed in order to do anything useful with it. Typically, transforming variables in GEE involves manipulating raw bands of imagery to create products like NDVI and EVI, or performing math operations with multiple datasets.&#xA;Dividing EVI by Precipitation In this example, EVI is being divided by precipitation data for Kansas, and the result is mapped.&#xA;Load and initialize rgee first!&#xA;library(rgee) ee_Initialize() # Define an area of interest (AOI) over Kansas aoi &amp;lt;- ee$Geometry$Rectangle(c(-102.</description>

      <description>Introduction From the rgee github page: &amp;ldquo;rgee is an R binding package for calling Google Earth Engine API from within R. Various functions are implemented to simplify the connection with the R spatial ecosystem.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;This guide assumes use of RStudio on a Mac, but I personally use Emacs with ESS and found it to work wonderfully. Any Unix based system should work similarly. Windows should theoretically work by following the below, but more work might be required and I haven&amp;rsquo;t tested it.</description>

      <description>Introduction Google Earth Engine provides access to a bunch of geospatial datasets including satellite imagery, climate data and land cover classifications. These datasets, known as variables, are used to perform geospatial analyses.&#xA;Calling variables Load and initialize rgee first!&#xA;Define an area that you want to visualize. The easiest way of doing this is to define a rectangle with coordinates.&#xA;aoi &amp;lt;- ee$Geometry$Rectangle(c(-120.4, 34.5, -119.4, 35.5)) In this example, I&amp;rsquo;ll use the MODIS land cover datasets.</description>

      <description>Introduction I set out with the goal to create documentation so that my process was both transparent and reproducible. While a word document probably would have sufficed, it simply would not have been as fun. Additionally, it seemed like anything I could publish to the web could be easily archived with something like the wayback machine and then could be easily referenced too without worrying about it&amp;rsquo;s longevity.</description>
