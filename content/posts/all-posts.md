The EGM-4 is a handheld IRGA with a backlit LCD screen, numeric keypad, a serial port, and two I/O ports. The device measures CO₂ concentration using infrared absorption, while connected probes give additional datapoints. Internal memory stores records organized by plot.

A few notes that may be useful: The EGM can store up to 999 records. Once you hit that limit, it starts overwriting the oldest record (e.g. 001) with new ones. However: the plot number, which is assigned to a set of records, can go up to 9999.
