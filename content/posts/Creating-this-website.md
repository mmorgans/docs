## Introduction {#introduction}

I set out with the goal to create documentation so that my process was both transparent and reproducible. While a word document probably would have sufficed, it simply would not have been as fun. Additionally, it seemed like anything I could publish to the web could be easily archived with something like the [wayback machine](https://waybackmachine.org) and then could be easily referenced too without worrying about it's longevity.
