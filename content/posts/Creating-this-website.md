## Introduction {#introduction}

I set out with the goal to create documentation so that my process was both transparent and reproducible. While a word document probably would have sufficed, it simply would not have been as fun. Additionally, it seemed like anything I could publish to the web could be easily archived with something like the [wayback machine](https://waybackmachine.org) and then could be easily linked to without worrying about it's longevity.


## Writing and formatting {#writing-and-formatting}

All posts are written in Emacs 29.4, using Doom 2.0.9, in Org mode.


## Publishing {#publishing}

Posts are published to markdown using ox-hugo, and pushed to GitHub using Magit. Hugo is used as a framework for the website, with a modified version of the papermod theme. I use Cloudflare for a the majority of domain work. Cloudflare pages is used for building the site.
